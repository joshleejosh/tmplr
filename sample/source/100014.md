blurb: How templates work.

Most `<@whatever@>` tags just correspond to items in an entry's header; other tags refer to system-wide constants.

There are a few special things you can do with tags:

* A tag ending in `-stripped` will take the text of the prefix item and strip if of HTML tags.
* A tag ending in `-escaped` will take the text of the prefix item and escape significant entities.
* The `date` tag outputs the date of the entry. There are a couple of special variants of this:
	* A `date-rfc3339` tag will format the datetime in RFC 3339 format (for the Atom feed's benefit, mainly).
	* A `date-ftime:<fmt>` tag lets you format the date in Python/C strftime format. (See `templates/empty.md` for an example.) There are a couple of extra flags you can put in the format string:
		* `%!l`: lowercase the result.
		* `%!u`: uppercase the result.
* A `<@loopentries-whatever@>` tag will loop over all entries in the current context and run them through the "whatever" template.

The "empty.md" template is used to generate a new blank entry; modify it if you want to add custom tags, have a particular format for your titles, etc.
