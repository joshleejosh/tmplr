blurb: How templates work.

Most `<@whatever@>` tags just correspond to items in an entry's header; other tags are system-wide constants. There are a couple of exceptions:

* A tag ending in `-stripped` will take the text of the prefix item and strip if of HTML tags.
* A `date-rfc3339` tag will format the datetime in RFC 3339 format (for the Atom feed's benefit, mainly). `date` just outputs the date in readable format.
* A `<@loopentries-whatever@>` tag will loop over all entries in the current context and run them through the "whatever" template.
