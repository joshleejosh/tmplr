blurb: Writing source files

A source file begins with a few lines of header info. `title`, `slug`, `date`, and `blurb` are required (blurb can be blank if you're not doing anything with it in your templates). You can add more headers as you please.

Everything after the header is body text. It's pretty straight Markdown.
