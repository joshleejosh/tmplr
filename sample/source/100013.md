blurb: Writing source files. 😍

A source file begins with a few lines of header info. `title`, `slug`, and `date` are required. You can add more headers as you please to make values accessible as template tags.

`tags` is a magic header. if you include it, it must be a comma-delimited list.

Everything after the header is body text. It's pretty straight Markdown.

You should be able to use Unicode characters in text, including emojis. 😱

Hopefully XML/HTML chars like &, <, and > escape correctly.

It should all look something like this:

    title: Source Files
    slug: source-files
